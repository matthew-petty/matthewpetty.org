*Writing by hand because I still can*

I'm a selective practitioner driven to make an impact. I specialize in contemporary municipal best practices, and my passion is helping cities make it easier to build good housing.

I've facilitated or consulted for municipalities and civic organizations in more than two dozen communities, including Overland Park, Memphis, South Bend, Orlando, Salt Lake City, Houston, and others. I was elected four times and served almost 13 years as a Councilmember in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where I sponsored new data-based processes and placemaking frameworks in transportation and tourism budgets.

## What I'm Building

**[Pattern Zones](https://patternzones.com)** — I'm designing and facilitating programs for a novel regulatory approach using pre-approved building plans. We built the first prototypes in 2017 and 2020 using custom-design portfolios. Next-generation programs are launching in 2025 in Fayetteville, AR; Overland Park, KS; and Lebanon, NH.

## Background

My work sits at the intersection of policy, design, and implementation. I've spent years in the trenches of local government and housing development—writing legislation, facilitating design workshops, syndicating capital, and managing construction.

On the **Fayetteville City Council**, I wrote and stewarded land use and health legislation including food trucks, pocket neighborhoods, accessory dwelling units, new zoning designations, traffic calming, and COVID response with budget allocations.

With the **Incremental Development Alliance**, I designed the process for stress testing municipal codes and facilitated stress tests in South Bend, Kalamazoo, and Overland Park. I delivered small-scale developer workshops to more than 20 communities and was the primary author of curriculum revisions still in use today. I served on the board from 2023–2024.

I've also worked as a **developer**. At 495 West Prairie Street in downtown Fayetteville, I managed a mixed-use walkup building from concept through construction—including capital syndication, team assembly, and leasing. The building has nine apartments, two offices, a smoothie bar, and a taproom.
